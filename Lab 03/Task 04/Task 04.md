## Task 4
Develop a C++ class named Point that represents a point in a 2D coordinate system, with two private integer variables x and y to store the coordinates. The class should include a
constructor that initializes these coordinates upon object creation and a copy constructor that allows one Point object to be initialized as a copy of another.
Additionally, the class should provide getter functions to access the x and y values
