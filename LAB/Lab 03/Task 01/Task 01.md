# Task 1

- Design a class named Book to encapsulate information about a book, such as title, author, and publication year.
- Implement a non-parameterized constructor to set default values for the attributes. Additionally, include a destructor that displays a message when an object of the class is destroyed.
- Provide an example of creating objects of the Book class, accessing their attributes, and observing the destructor message upon object destruction.
