## Task 5
Implement a C++ class named Wall that represents the dimensions of a wall. The class should include private data members length and height, and provide a parameterized constructor for initializing these values. Additionally, you need to implement a copy constructor that duplicates the data of another Wall object. The class should also have
two methods: calculateArea() to compute and display the wall&#39;s area using the formula length * height, and calculateArea2() to compute the area using the values of private
variables l and h. In the main() function, create an instance of the Wall class and initialize it with specific dimensions. Then, create a second object by copying the first
object using the copy constructor. Finally, calculate and display the areas of both wall objects using the two area calculation methods.
