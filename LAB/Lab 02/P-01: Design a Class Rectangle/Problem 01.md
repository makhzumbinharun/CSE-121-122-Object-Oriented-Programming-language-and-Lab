# Problem 01: The Rectangle Class

## Description
Design a class named `Rectangle` that represents a geometric rectangle. The class must encapsulate the dimensions of the shape and provide functionality to compute its geometric properties.

## Class Specifications
Your class should include the following:

1.  **Attributes**:
    * `length`: A private variable (integer or double) to store the length.
    * `width`: A private variable (integer or double) to store the width.
2.  **Methods**:
    * Public methods to calculate and return the **Area**.
    * Public methods to calculate and return the **Perimeter**.
    * *(Optional)* Getters and Setters to assign values to the private attributes.

## Task
In your `main` function:
1.  Create an object of the `Rectangle` class.
2.  Set the `length` and `width` of the rectangle.
3.  Calculate and display the **Area** and **Perimeter** based on the set values.

## Formulas
$$\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}$$
$$\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})$$
